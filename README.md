# Utilizing Machine Learning to Predict Players' Salaries in NBA

# Project Introduction
  This project was made ro answer the following question for NBA player: "Am I worth what I am earning?". From rookie players to well-experienced super stars in NBA, players sign contract based on what they can give to the team on the way of championship. 
  By this project, players can value themselves and even foresee themselves in te future to sign their dream contract. 

# Methods
  In this project, I used salary and stats datasets from basketball-reference.com to answer this question. Utilizing the Pandas module and other libraries such as, MatplotLib, Numpy, Seabor and other machine learning libraries in Python, I cleaned and wrangled the data. I then visualized the data to find any obvious trends in the data. 
   After selecting which features are important to the salary, I used various machine learning algorithms to try and yield and accurate prediction of the player's salary based on their stats from the previous year.
